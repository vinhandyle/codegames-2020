## About
My entry to the 2020 Code Games Challenge. This is an action-adventure platformer programmed in C# using Unity over the summer before my freshman year of college (June-Sept 2020).

This is a PC, Mac & Linux Standalone game. It has a fixed 452x470 windowed screen.

For more in-depth information about the game, download the Game Design Document (Word Doc).

### Downloading and Running the Game
Navigate into the Build Versions folder (codegames-2020/CodeGamesSummer2020/Build Versions) and download the zip file for the latest version (1.0). After extracting the files, the game can be opened from Salvation.exe.
