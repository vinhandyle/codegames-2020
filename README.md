# Salvation
## About
My entry to the 2020 Code Games Challenge. This is an action-adventure platformer programmed in C# using Unity over the summer before college (June-Oct 2020). 

This is a PC, Mac & Linux Standalone game with a fixed 452x470 windowed screen. To run the game, execute Salvation.exe after extracting the latest release.

For more in-depth information about the game, check out the Game Design Document (PDF).
